def get_eda_features(data: ndarray, sampling_rate: int = 4) -> ndarray:
    """This method performs the feature extraction for an EDA signal (be it mixed or phasic).
    The features extracted are: statistical features (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation,
    difference between maximum and minimum value or dynamic change, slope, absolute value
    of the slope, mean and standard deviation of the first derivative), number of peaks,
    peaksâ€™ amplitude.
    The features extracted follow what done by Di Lascio et al. (2019).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        eda data to extract features from.
    sampling_rate : int, optional
        sampling rate of the eda features, in Hz, by default 4.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        the method returns an array of extracted features, in the order given in the
        description, i.e.,
        `[min, max, mean, std, diff_max_min, slope, absolute_slope, mean_derivative,
        std_derivative,number_peaks,peaks_amplitude]`
